In my first post, I mentioned that I have limited time to spend on my game dev ambitions so it's important that the hours I do spend are productive. I watched a <a href=https://youtu.be/g5f7yixtQPc>GDC talk by David Wehle</a> (<a href=https://www.thefirsttree.com/>The First Tree</a>) who mentioned he spent roughly 10 hours a week on his game, due to work commitments and real-life - and that he never had a 0% day. Every day should have <em>some</em> progress, no matter how small. These are tenets I'd like to follow.<h3 id=checking-out-unreal>Checking out Unreal</h3><p>I spent the past year learning Unity - so a question I openly ask myself is why should I learn Unreal Engine? I haven't released anything in Unity, but I feel I have a strong grasp on the fundamentals - and C# is a very pleasant language to work with. Their headquarters are also just a few blocks from Fandom in San Francisco. I do however have some gripes.<p>At the moment Unity feels like it's in-between phases. There is a LARGE amount of really cool stuff coming from Unity - "soon". The <a href=https://unity.com/dots>Data Oriented Technology Stack</a> (DOTS), a revamped <a href=https://unity.com/solutions/multiplayer-services>networking and multiplayer system</a>, a new <a href=https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/04/23/whats-new-with-uielements-in-2019-1/>UI system</a> replacing years of not-good-enough solutions - and <a href=https://blogs.unity3d.com/>much more</a>. The problem is - these are all not-quite-there yet. They represent large changes in how to make games in Unity, and when you want to learn how to do something, you'll get 2 answers - how to do it now, and how to do it "soon".<p>Obviously, investing time in learning something that will soon be deprecated isn't great, but the replacements are also in a constant state of change. This feeling of limbo is strongly felt in the Unity community at the moment, and I think for new developers it's a particularly difficult time to get started.<p>Unreal on the other hand has made statements that Unreal 4 projects will be forwards-compatible with it's 5th edition. That's exciting. They aren't however particularly indie-friendly, and learning resources are considerably slimmer by comparison.<p><img alt="A first look at Unreal Engine 5 - Unreal Engine" src=https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine%2Fblog%2Fa-first-look-at-unreal-engine-5%2FUE5_Announcement_Feed_Large-1920x1080-8c8ab609059186399d92ca5dc8a748e62880e0e7.jpg>Unreal Engine 5<h3 id=my-game-goals>My game goals</h3><p>I'm going to be experimenting in both game engines until I land on a prototype I think is worth pursuing. I'm not married to either game engine yet, but I think it's important to explore all of the options available.<p>I'm also not entirely sure what type of game I'm going to be making yet, but I have plenty of interests that should help guide my learning. I'm mostly interested in finding out what I can reasonably achieve as a one-person team in a year or two. Some of these interests include:<ul><li>Single-player, story driven games<li>Procedural generation<li>Sound and music design<li>Visual effects, particle systems<li>Lighting (particularly - dynamic lighting)</ul><h3 id=what-s-up-first>What's up first?</h3><p>In Unity, it took me around a week to get a well running procedural terrain generator off the ground. I expect with Unreal (and very rusty C++ knowledge) this could be longer. I've started looking already, and the resources available are very slim. Most reading around proc-gen in Unreal is focused on Blueprints and existing plugins, which don't seem particularly flexible to the experimentation I'd like to do.<p>I'll be working on some prototypes in both engines to see what I enjoy more, and go from there.</section></article></main></div><footer>Copyright Â© 2022.<div class=attribution>Built with <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a>, based on <a href=https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo>Apollo</a>, and hosted on <a href=https://netlify.com/>Netlify</a>.</div></footer>
