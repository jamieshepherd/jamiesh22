I expect to add to this list over time.<h3 id=ecco-the-dolphin>Ecco the Dolphin</h3><p>One of the first games I played. Loved the feeling of diving deeper and deeper into the unknown (might be why I enjoyed Subnautica so much).<p><img alt="Ecco The Dolphin (1992) Mega Drive Classic Review" src=ecco.jpg><h3 id=comix-zone>Comix Zone</h3><p>This had a novel art style, where everything was drawn into the scene by an artist "literally". Navigating between scenes was jumping across the pages, tearing parts of the paper. Very creative.<p><img alt="Comix Zone | ClassicReload.com" src=comix-zone.png><h3 id=the-secret-of-monkey-island>The Secret of Monkey Island</h3><p>Great puzzles, funny dialogue, classic.<p><img alt="The Secret of Monkey Island • The Register" src=monkey-island.webp><h3 id=seven-kingdoms>Seven Kingdoms</h3><p>Interesting mechanics around population, integrating different races.<p><img alt="Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries on GOG.com" src=seven-kingdoms.jpg><h3 id=settlers-3>Settlers 3</h3><p>The territory mechanic of Settlers 3 was fantastic, and to my knowledge hasn't been done as well since. You can expand your territory with special settlers, but only cement the territory with towers.<p><img alt="Try The Settlers 3 History Edition for free from 09.01.2020 to ..." src=settlers-3.jpg><h3 id=half-life-1-2>Half-Life 1 & 2</h3><p>Classic. Spawned an amazing modding scene. Both games were revolutionary for their time.<p><img alt="Half-Life NPCs Can Smell Corpses" src=half-life.webp><h3 id=counter-strike-1-6>Counter-Strike 1.6</h3><p>I spent about 10 years playing Counter-Strike, semi-professionally. Nothing has matched the gameplay "feel" to me since. This could obviously be nostalgia, but something about the way enemies fly back after being headshot felt amazing. Also had an innovative economy, and classic maps that stood the test of time and are still fun more than 15 years later.<p><img alt="Half-Life NPCs Can Smell Corpses" src=counter-strike.jpg><h3 id=world-of-warcraft>World of Warcraft</h3><p>Great social experience, but this was the first game where I fell in love with the world. Each zone was distinct and recognizable, had its own music, different NPCs. It was scary as a low level to visit high level places - but you knew at some point you'd be strong enough to venture further.<p><img alt="Ironforge Enrtance Gathering at World of Warcraft Nexus - Mods and ..." src=world-of-warcraft.jpg><h3 id=bioshock-infinite>Bioshock Infinite</h3><p>The art style of Bioshock Infinite drew me in, having been a huge fan of the previous games - this one became an instant classic for me. As far as story-writing in games goes, this was the pinnacle for me. The closing scene left me speechless for minutes. I would love to make a game that has this effect on players.<p><img alt="Time Sink: Columbia Tourism And Gaming Photojournalism In ..." src=bioshock-infinite.jpg><h3 id=farcry-5>Farcry 5</h3><p>I had low expectations of FC5, but it really blew me away. This is another game where the world felt like a character itself. It felt technologically impressive in its scale, and everything in the world felt "alive". Characters, wildlife, plants. The story on top of this was really just a bonus, and it was a gift to journey through.<p><img alt="The Wild, Wild Country of 'Far Cry 5' - The Ringer" src=farcry-5.jpg></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=https://jamie.sh/tags/games/>Games</a><li><a href=https://jamie.sh/tags/inspiration/>Inspiration</a></ul></nav></div></article></main></div><footer>Copyright © 2022.<div class=attribution>Built with <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a>, based on <a href=https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo>Apollo</a>, and hosted on <a href=https://netlify.com/>Netlify</a>.</div></footer>
